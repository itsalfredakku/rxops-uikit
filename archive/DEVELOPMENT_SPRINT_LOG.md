| HealthDashboard | ✅ COMPLETED | 100% | 90% | Patient overview dashboard with metrics, appointments, alerts |
| ProviderDashboard | � NEXT | 0% | 0% | Healthcare provider workspace and patient queue |

### Development Approach
- **Parallel Development:** Multiple components developed simultaneously ✅
- **Test-Driven:** Test cases written alongside component development ✅
- **Quality Gates:** Components pass accessibility, healthcare compliance checks
- **Demo Integration:** Components integrated into demo as completed
- **Qwik Optimization:** All components built with Qwik's reactive patterns

1. ✅ **MedicalHistory Component** - Complete timeline view with filtering, search, and event expansion
2. ✅ **PrescriptionManagement Component** - Full medication management with refill tracking and drug interactions
3. ✅ **LabResults Component** - Comprehensive lab results display with trends, reference ranges, and critical alerts
4. ✅ **HealthDashboard Component** - Patient overview dashboard with health metrics, appointments, and alerts
5. ✅ **ProviderDashboard Component** - Complete healthcare provider workspace with patient queue, schedule, notifications, and metrics
6. ✅ **EmergencyAlert Component** - Critical alert system with severity levels, escalation, notifications, responders, and actions
7. ✅ **BillingCard Component** - Medical billing and payment processing with comprehensive prop interface, multiple payment states, and realistic mock data
8. ✅ **ImagingViewer Component** - Advanced medical imaging viewer with DICOM support, multi-modality display, annotations, measurements, zoom/pan controls, and window/level presets
9. ✅ **VideoCall Component** - Complete telemedicine video calling with WebRTC, HIPAA-compliant recording, screen sharing, multi-participant support, and role-based access controls
10. ✅ **Test Coverage** - Simplified tests for all new components (adapted for Qwik limitations)
11. ✅ **Healthcare Compliance** - HIPAA-compliant data handling and role-based access patterns
12. ✅ **Demo Integration** - All components integrated into dedicated demo project with comprehensive demos
13. ✅ **Type Safety** - Fixed EmergencyAlert test type error (EmergencyResource status from 'available' to 'deployed')
14. ✅ **ConsultationNotes Test Fix** - Fixed missing 'tags' property type error in consultation-notes.test.tsx by adding required tags array to mock MedicalNote data

### Technical Notes
- **Qwik Testing Limitations**: Using simplified DOM testing due to QRL serialization and node.isAncestor issues
- **Component Architecture**: All components follow consistent patterns with proper prop interfaces
- **Healthcare Features**: Each component includes healthcare-specific features (HIPAA, medical coding, etc.)
- **Mobile Responsive**: All components designed mobile-first with Tailwind CSS
- **Code Quality**: Lint errors remain in some components - addressed in future cleanup sprint

### Next Actions (Priority 3 - Advanced Features)
