# RxOps UI Component Library - Improvement Recommendations

## 🎯 **Immediate Priority Improvements**

### 1. **Enhanced Accessibility & ARIA Support**
**Impact**: High | **Effort**: Medium

**Current Issues:**
- Missing ARIA labels and descriptions
- Incomplete keyboard navigation support
- No screen reader optimizations

**Suggested Improvements:**
- Add comprehensive ARIA attributes to all interactive components
- Implement proper focus management and keyboard navigation
- Add screen reader specific text for loading states and dynamic content
- Include high contrast mode support

**Example Implementation:**
```tsx
export interface ButtonProps {
  // ... existing props
  ariaLabel?: string;
  ariaDescribedBy?: string;
  ariaPressed?: boolean;
  role?: string;
  loading?: boolean;
  loadingText?: string;
}
```

### 2. **Form Validation & Error Handling**
**Impact**: High | **Effort**: Medium

**Current Issues:**

- Real-time validation feedback
- Integration with form state management

### 3. **Loading States & Skeleton Components**
**Impact**: Medium | **Effort**: Low

**Current Issues:**
- No skeleton loading states
- Basic spinner component only
- Poor perceived performance

**Suggested Improvements:**
- ✅ **CREATED**: `skeleton.tsx` with healthcare-specific skeletons
- Shimmer animations for better UX
- Context-aware loading states
- Progressive loading for data-heavy components

### 4. **Enhanced Healthcare Components**
**Impact**: High | **Effort**: High

**Current Issues:**
