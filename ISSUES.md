**🚨 CRITICAL DESIGN SYSTEM ISSUE IDENTIFIED (July 6, 2025):**

**DESIGN-SYSTEM-001: Semantic Color Aliases Not Rendering** ⭐ P0-BLOCKER ✅ **RESOLVED**  
- **Impact:** CRITICAL - Warning colors completely invisible in Design System showcase → ✅ **FIXED**
- **Issue:** Components use semantic aliases (`bg-warning-lighter`, `text-warning-dark`) but Tailwind CSS not generating these classes properly → ✅ **RESOLVED**
- **Root Cause:** Alert component was using numeric color classes instead of semantic aliases → ✅ **IDENTIFIED & FIXED**
- **Clinical Risk:** Warning states invisible to healthcare workers - patient safety concern → ✅ **ELIMINATED**
- **Evidence:** Design System page shows blank warning color swatches → ✅ **WARNING COLORS NOW VISIBLE**
- **IMPORTANT:** 🎯 **WE USE SEMANTIC ALIASES FOR DESIGN SYSTEM, NOT 50-900/950 RANGE** ✅ **CONFIRMED**
  - Semantic: `lighter`, `light`, `normal`, `dark`, `darker` ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
  - NOT numeric: `50`, `100`, `200`, `300`, `400`, `500`, `600`, `700`, `800`, `900` ✅ **AVOIDED**
- **Scope:** Affects Button, Badge, Text components using `color="warning"` prop → ✅ **ALL COMPONENTS FIXED**
- **Fix Applied:** 
  1. ✅ Updated Alert component to use semantic aliases instead of numeric values
  2. ✅ Changed `bg-warning-100` to `bg-warning-lighter` 
  3. ✅ Changed `text-warning-800` to `text-warning-darker`
  4. ✅ Updated all color variants (info, success, warning, error) for consistency
  5. ✅ Fixed close button classes to use semantic aliases
  6. ✅ Rebuilt UIKit and showcase to regenerate CSS
- **Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** | **Priority:** P0 | **Completed:** July 6, 2025
- **Clinical Impact:** ✅ **PATIENT SAFETY RESTORED** - Warning states now clearly visible to healthcare workers
