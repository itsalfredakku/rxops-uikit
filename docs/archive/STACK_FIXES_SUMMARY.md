# Stack Component Standardization - Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

1. Fixed missing closing tag for `<Stack>` component in lab-results.tsx
   - Was causing syntax errors and breaking the build

2. Removed reference to deleted component in src/index.ts
   - Removed `export { Stack as ComponentStack } from "./core/organisms/stack/stack";` since the file was deleted

## Current State

### Source Code
- All Stack components in the source code now use numeric gap values (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.)
- All imports are correctly pointing to the layouts version of the Stack component
- No references to StackGap remain in the source code
- No errors in the source code

### Demo Files
- Demo files still use semantic gap values (xs, sm, md, lg, xl)
- Demo files can't be updated until the library is rebuilt with proper type definitions

### Type Definitions
- Source code type definitions have been updated
- Compiled type definitions in lib-types still have the old semantic values

## Next Steps

1. Rebuild the library
   - Run `npm run build.lib` to update the compiled type definitions

2. Update demo files
   - After rebuilding the library, use the update-stack-gaps.js script to convert semantic values to numeric ones
   - Replace "none" → "0", "xs" → "2", "sm" → "3", "md" → "4", "lg" → "8", "xl" → "16"

3. Test components
   - Verify that all components render correctly with the new gap values

## Recommendations

1. Add comments in the Stack component to document the gap values
2. Consider adding a warning in the demo files about the ongoing migration
3. Update documentation to reflect the standardized numeric gap system
