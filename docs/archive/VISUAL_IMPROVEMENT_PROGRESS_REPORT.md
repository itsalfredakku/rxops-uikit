### **Component Enhancements**
```tsx
// Enhanced Button with comprehensive interaction states
const buttonBase = [
  "hover:shadow-lg hover:scale-[1.02] hover:brightness-105",
  "focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-primary-500",
  "active:scale-[0.98] active:shadow-sm",
  "transition-all duration-200"
];

// Enhanced Badge with interactive states
const getHoverClasses = () => {
  if (!isInteractive) return "";
  return "hover:shadow-md hover:scale-105 transition-all duration-200 cursor-pointer";
};

// Enhanced Switch with glove-friendly interactions
"hover:shadow-md hover:scale-105",
"hover:bg-primary-darker transition-all duration-200"
