## üé¨ **MOTION ACCESSIBILITY FEATURES**

### **Motion Preference Detection**
```typescript
// Real-time motion preference monitoring
const reducedMotion = useMotionPreference();

// Automatic motion-aware class generation
const animationClasses = getAnimationClasses(
  'hover:scale-[1.02] transition-all duration-200',  // Default
  'hover:brightness-110 transition-colors duration-150', // Reduced motion
  isEmergency // Force animation for patient safety
);
```

### **Healthcare Timing Standards**
```typescript
HEALTHCARE_TIMING = {
  micro: { duration: 'duration-100', ease: 'ease-out' },     // Button hover
  short: { duration: 'duration-200', ease: 'ease-out' },     // Tooltips
  emergency: { duration: 'duration-150', ease: 'ease-out' }, // Critical alerts
  // ... with motion-reduce variants
}
```

### **Emergency Override System**
```typescript
// Life-threatening alerts maintain visibility
animate-pulse motion-reduce:animate-pulse  // Always animated for safety
ring-4 ring-error-500/50                  // Visual prominence maintained
```
